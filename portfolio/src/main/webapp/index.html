      <h2>Here is a little about myself and my projects. Enjoy!</h2>
      <p>Ever since I was a little girl, I have always wanted to be an engineer. Below is a picture of my answer to when my parents asked us to write down our dreams. I was bout 8 years old</p>

      <p>(Ingenieur is french for engineer. I was raised speaking both English and French so "Frenglish" was my language of choice)</p>
      <p>Now, I have just completed my third year of Computer Engineering at McGill University. It really is a dream coming true! You can see me, on the McGill campus, this past semester:</p>
      <img src="images/me_at_mcgill.jpeg" style="width:300px;height:400px;"/>
      <p>Throughout the years I haved worked on many different projects to narrow down which type of engineering I wanted to study. So I started participating in science fairs. 
          In total, I have participated in 4 different competitions competing at different levels from regionals to nationals.

      <p>This is a picture of my first high school competition. I was 14. It was a system that detects whether or not to turn on the lights in a room depending on the movement in the room 
          and the existing light coming from the windows. It also controlled the blinds of the room to allow for maximum lighting.

      <p>This is my second project at 15. It was a system that checks if an elderly person living at home alone has fallen and hasn't gotten back up. It then alerts the designated person (family member or caregiver)</p>
      <br>

      <p>The following year, I created a system, including a small portable ECG, that can analyse someone's heart signal and determine if they have artirial fibrillation (the most common heart arythmia in Canada)</p>
      <br>
      <img src="images/expo-sciences-sec5.jpg" style="width:600px;height:400px;"/>
      <p>My final project used brainwaves acquired from an EEG integrated in a baseball cap to determine if a driver is falling asleep at the wheel before any of the physical symptoms appear. The system then sounds an alarm to wake the driver up</p>
      <p>Since then, I started a Technology Discovery Camp so that students aged 11 to 15 can learn all about electronics and programming through hands on projects and visits to tech companies in their region.</p>
      <h2>Other interests</h2>
      <p>I have also gotten the opportunity to travel a lot in my life. I have visited 23 countries and am only 22 years old. My goal is to always try to keep the number of countries I have visited higher than my age. COVID is making that hard this year.</p>

      <p>I also enjoy staying active by partcipating in many different sports!</p>

      <p>Finally, during my last years of high school, I was in my school's philharmonic orchestra. I played the trumbone in school for 5 years and in the orchestra for 3. Here is a picture, you can see me a little in the back.</p>
      <img src="images/orchestra2.jpg" style="width:600px;height:400px;"/>
      <p>I belive in positive thinking. It can get you through very difficult times. If you need a littel extra inspiration today, 
          here are some of my favourite quotes about always trying and not being afraid to be a little different:
